* TODO [#B] Consider using HLint
* TODO [#C] Consider using the full-fledged lens instead of microlens
* TODO [#C] Proper run commands
* TODO [#C] Consider using hoogle
* TODO Use size-indexed vectors (vector-sized) whenever possible
  We don't do this yet. Haskell isn't a dependently-typed language,
  and attempting to simulate it only clutters the (already
  complicated) code. Also, emulations are also not efficient at
* TODO [#A] Consider using Data.Some.Newtype from "some" on Hackage instead of hand-rolled Data.Poly.Strict
* TODO [#C] Consider using "dependent-map" instead of typerep-map
* TODO [#A] More biomes
  run-time (e.g. =Finite= being represented as =Integer=).
* DONE [#A] Make "river" in Chunk debug-only
* DONE [#A] Use TH for unboxed vectors
* DONE [#A] Consider using polydata instead of hand-rolling Some*
* DONE [#B] Templetize registries with CPP
  Decided not to do this. Its' simply not worth it.
* DONE [#B] Try injective type families for things like EntityType
  I tried hard. I tried really hard, but I couldn't get rid of the
  type family =EntityTypeOf=. Injective type families really doesn't
  play nice with existential types it appears. Maybe I should give up
  making =Poly EntityType= (or equivalently =SomeEntityType=) an
  instance of =EntityType=, like what I did for =SomeBiomeProxy=.
** Note
   After that I did exactly that.
* DONE OOP constructor for =EntityType=
  But its argument would differ for each entity type, which means we
  need to do some kind of dynamic type casting.
* DONE [#A] Bias oceans towards lands
* DONE [#A] Change the Z mapping threshold
