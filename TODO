* TODO Use size-indexed vectors (vector-sized) whenever possible
  We don't do this yet. Haskell isn't a dependently-typed language,
  and attempting to simulate it only clutters the (already
  complicated) code. Also, emulations are also not efficient at
  run-time (e.g. =Finite= being represented as =Integer=).
* DONE [#A] Make "river" in Chunk debug-only
* DONE [#A] Use TH for unboxed vectors
* DONE [#A] Consider using polydata instead of hand-rolling Some*
* DONE [#B] Templetize registries with CPP
  Decided not to do this. Its' simply not worth it.
